OctoinCoin Core 0.13.0
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[octoin Core](https://octoin.com/) is the original octoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of octoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run octoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/octoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/octoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run octoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag octoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run octoin-Core.
